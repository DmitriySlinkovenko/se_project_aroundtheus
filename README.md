**Intro**

This project is about sharing the love of travel between fellow Americans. Most people spend lifetimes without visiting most breathtaking places in their homeland. This app will provide people a platform to share their happy moments with others, inspiring the latest to go on an adventure of their own. Features customizable avatars, and description of every user on any device. Upload pictures, sign them, like pictures of other to show your support - it can all be done, on all popular screen sizes.
